            The Cosimoâ€™s family tradition begins with a passion for culinary
            excellence. It continues with a storied reputation for award-winning
            cuisine, and a legacy spanning more than 50 years. It continues
            today in The Pizza Shop, where passion and tradition meet in a warm,
            inviting and contemporary atmosphere.

            Voted Best in the Hudson Valley, The Pizza Shop is old-school, yes,
            but not old-fashioned. Recipes that have been in the family for
            generations have been carefully reimagined. Familiar dishes
            including our pizza, pasta, and wings have been done a little
            differently, given new, enticing twists.{" "}

            And, as always, the freshest local ingredients are used in all of
            our dishes, from entrees to our farm-fresh salads, whenever
            possible. Even our ice cream is handmade in small batches in the
            Hudson Valley using hormone-free New York State milk and Cream.
